    "readme": "# 1Password for HyperTerm\n\nExtension for [HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org/) that adds [1Password](https://1password.com) integration.\n\n![1Password and HyperTerm in action](http://i.imgur.com/ERv1A4M.gif)\n\n### How to use\n\n1. Install HyperTerm\n2. Add `hyperterm-1password` to plugins in `~/.hyperterm.js`.\n3. Use `Cmd + \\` to open the 1Password modal.\n\n### Configuring 1Password to work with HyperTerm\n\nIf you're using 1Password 5+, or you run into this screen:\n\n![Cannot Fill Item in Web Browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenac95/readme-images/master/sudolikeaboss/cannot-fill-item-error-popup.png)\n\nThis causes a problem for `HyperTerm` as it isn't a \"trusted browser\" per se.\nIn order to fix this issue, you need to do the following:\n\n1. Open up 1Password's preferences\n2. Find the `Advanced` settings tab.\n3. Uncheck `Verify browser code signature`.\n\n![Uncheck \"Verify browser code signature\"](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/889219/6270365/a69a0726-b816-11e4-9b96-558ddeb00378.png)\n\n### Configuring passwords in 1Password\n\nSo that 1Password automatically displays logins relevant to HyperTerm, add a website field to each login with a value of:\n\n`sudolikeaboss://local`\n\nThis also ensures compatibility with the [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) plugin, [sudolikeaboss](https://github.com/ravenac95/sudolikeaboss).\n\n![Adding website field to 1Password login item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenac95/readme-images/master/sudolikeaboss/add-password.gif)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nA big thank you to [Reuven V. Gonzales](https://github.com/ravenac95) for his work on [sudolikeaboss](https://github.com/ravenac95/sudolikeaboss) and the 1Password screenshots above. `HyperTerm` is largely based on `sudolikeaboss`.\n\nAlso a big thank you to [AgileBits](https://agilebits.com/) for bringing us [1Password](https://1password.com/).\n",
